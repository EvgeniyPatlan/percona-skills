description: "Data-at-rest encryption and keyring management in Percona Server for MySQL. Use when encrypting InnoDB tablespaces, binary/relay logs, redo/undo logs, or temporary files; choosing or configuring a keyring (file, HashiCorp Vault, KMIP, AWS KMS); rotating the master key; or verifying what is encrypted. IMPORTANT — Percona Server provides binary-log encryption, temp-file encryption, and the Vault/KMIP/AWS-KMS keyrings in the OPEN-SOURCE build (these are MySQL Enterprise-only upstream). Encryption uses a two-tier master-key→tablespace-key hierarchy; the keyring must be loaded at startup BEFORE encrypted redo logs or binlogs can open, or the server won't start. Use keyring COMPONENTS, not the removed legacy plugins."

# Percona Server Encryption & Keyring

*Last updated: 2026-05-27*

Percona Server encrypts data at rest with a **two-tier key hierarchy**: a per-instance **master key** wraps each tablespace's **tablespace key**, which encrypts data pages (decrypted at the I/O layer — the buffer pool holds plaintext). This makes master-key rotation cheap (re-wrap keys, don't re-encrypt data). Percona ships several capabilities that are Enterprise-only in upstream MySQL: binary/relay-log encryption, temp-file encryption, and the Vault/KMIP/AWS-KMS keyrings.

> **Versions:** Keyring **components** (not the removed `keyring_file` plugin) are the supported model on 8.0+/8.4. Verify with `SELECT * FROM performance_schema.keyring_component_status;`. The keyring must load at startup before any encrypted redo log or binlog opens.

## What LLMs Get Wrong

| What you might see | What's correct |
|---|---|
| "Binary-log encryption / Vault keyring needs MySQL Enterprise" | All open-source in Percona Server — `binlog_encryption`, plus the Vault, KMIP, and AWS KMS keyring components |
| `--early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so` on 8.4 | The legacy plugin is gone — use `component_keyring_file` via the `mysqld.my` manifest |
| Putting keyring settings in `my.cnf` `[mysqld]` | Components are configured in a JSON `.cnf` in the plugin dir; the `mysqld.my` manifest declares which to load |
| Assuming `ENCRYPTION='Y'` on a table also encrypts binlogs | Independent — table uses the tablespace master key; binlogs need `binlog_encryption=ON` (separate key) |
| `SET GLOBAL innodb_redo_log_encrypt=ON` and expecting it to persist | Lost on restart — set it in `my.cnf`. It only affects newly written pages, not existing ones |
| Forgetting the keyring at startup when redo logs are encrypted | InnoDB can't scan encrypted redo → normal restart fails. Keyring must be available first |
| Enabling two keyring components "for redundancy" | Only **one** keyring per instance — multiple may cause data loss |
| Rotating the master key by deleting/replacing the keyring file | Destroys access to all encrypted data. Use `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY` |
| Switching plugin→component without migrating keys | Existing encrypted tables become unreadable — migrate keys first (`mysql_migrate_keyring`) |
| Trusting `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to prove on-disk encryption | It reports the *setting*, not that every page is ciphertext |

## Keyring Backends (choose one)

Each backend uses a manifest `mysqld.my` (next to the `mysqld` binary) plus a `.cnf` in the plugin dir. **Only one keyring per instance.**

```json
// mysqld.my — declare the component
{ "components": "file://component_keyring_file" }
```
| Backend | Component | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| File | `component_keyring_file` | Dev / single host. The file is a single point of failure — its loss = unrecoverable data |
| HashiCorp Vault | `component_keyring_vault` | Production, central key management + audit. Needs Vault URL/token/CA; one mount point per server |
| KMIP | `component_keyring_kmip` | Enterprise KMS (Thales, Fortanix, Vault Enterprise KMIP) — `server_addr`/`port` + client/server certs |
| AWS KMS | `component_keyring_kms` | AWS workloads — `region`, `kms_key`, AWS credentials |

```json
// <plugin_dir>/component_keyring_vault.cnf
{ "vault_url": "https://vault.example.com:8202", "secret_mount_point": "secret",
  "secret_mount_point_version": "AUTO", "token": "<token>", "vault_ca": "/path/ca.crt" }
```

## What You Can Encrypt

```sql
-- Per-table / schema default
CREATE TABLE app.t (id INT) ENCRYPTION='Y';
ALTER TABLE app.t ENCRYPTION='Y';            -- no ENCRYPTION clause = no change
ALTER SCHEMA app DEFAULT ENCRYPTION='Y';     -- or SET default_table_encryption=ON;
CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ENCRYPTION='Y';        -- general tablespace (all tables uniform)
ALTER TABLESPACE mysql ENCRYPTION='Y';       -- system tablespace
```
Set in `my.cnf` (persistent; affect newly written pages only):
```ini
innodb_redo_log_encrypt = ON
innodb_undo_log_encrypt = ON
binlog_encryption       = ON      # binary + relay logs (index files never encrypted)
encrypt_tmp_files       = ON      # Percona: OS temp files (startup-only)
innodb_temp_tablespace_encrypt = ON
```
Doublewrite pages are encrypted automatically for encrypted tablespaces (no variable). `binlog_encryption` and the redo/undo toggles can be flipped at runtime with `BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN` / dynamically, but persist them in `my.cnf` too.

## Enforce, Rotate & Verify

```sql
-- Require privilege to deviate from the schema default
SET GLOBAL table_encryption_privilege_check = ON;   -- needs TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN to override

-- Cheap master-key rotation (re-wraps tablespace keys; one page-0 write each)
ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY;   -- needs ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN

-- Verify
SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME, CREATE_OPTIONS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE CREATE_OPTIONS LIKE '%ENCRYPTION%';
SELECT space, name, (flag & 8192) != 0 AS encrypted FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESPACES;
SHOW BINARY LOGS;                                    -- Encrypted column per file
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.keyring_component_status;
```
