Use when working with Percona Server, reviewing MySQL code or schema that runs on Percona Server, asking what Percona Server adds over community MySQL, tuning instrumentation/observability, configuring data-at-rest encryption, auditing, the MyRocks engine, threadpool, or backup locking. Also use when deciding whether Percona Server's extra features help a given workload. IMPORTANT — Percona Server is a TRUE drop-in binary replacement for the matching MySQL version (8.0, 8.4 LTS, 9.x): same SQL, same wire protocol, same replication.

# Percona Server for MySQL — Features Worth Knowing

*Last updated: 2026-05-26*

Percona Server for MySQL is an enhanced, fully open-source, **drop-in replacement** for Oracle MySQL. It tracks upstream MySQL release-for-release and stays binary- and protocol-compatible, then adds instrumentation, security, and operational features — several of which are Enterprise-only or absent in community MySQL. AI agents default to generic MySQL advice and rarely suggest these.

For backups (Percona XtraBackup), `pt-*` tools (Percona Toolkit), clustering (PXC), monitoring (PMM), and Kubernetes, see the sibling skills.

> **Version context:** There is **no single default** — Percona Server ships matched to the MySQL release it is built from: **8.0**, **8.4 LTS**, and **9.x Innovation**. Always confirm the running version (`SELECT VERSION();` → e.g. `8.4.8-8`) before relying on a feature. Per-feature tags below are **minimum versions**. Because Percona Server inherits upstream behavior, MySQL 8.4 changes (e.g. `caching_sha2_password` default, removal of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` / `CHANGE MASTER TO`) apply to Percona Server 8.4 too — see the `mysql-to-percona-server` skill.

## What LLMs Get Wrong

| What you might see | What's correct |
|---|---|
| "Percona Server has different SQL syntax / isn't a real drop-in" | It **is** a drop-in for the matching MySQL version — identical SQL, protocol, and replication. Only *extra* features and some defaults differ |
| Treating Percona Server like MariaDB (no `RETURNING`, `SEQUENCE`, GTID incompatibility) | Wrong product. Percona Server == MySQL semantics. MariaDB-isms do not apply |
| Hand-rolling per-table/per-user query stats from the slow log | Use built-in **User Statistics** (`userstat=ON`) — `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CLIENT_STATISTICS`, `TABLE_STATISTICS`, `INDEX_STATISTICS`, `USER_STATISTICS` |
| `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` to take a consistent backup | Use **backup locks**: `LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP` (Percona) or `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` (MySQL-native) — far less blocking; this is what XtraBackup uses |
| "Install the audit plugin from MySQL Enterprise" | Percona Server bundles the open-source **Audit Log Filter** component (and the older Audit Log plugin) — no Enterprise license |
| "Use the MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool" | Percona Server includes an open-source **threadpool** (`thread_handling=pool-of-threads`) |
| "Keyring Vault needs MySQL Enterprise" | Percona Server ships the **HashiCorp Vault keyring** component in the open-source build |
| Killing stuck idle transactions with a cron of `KILL` | `SET GLOBAL kill_idle_transaction = N;` ends transactions idle longer than N seconds |
| Storing IP/blob columns uncompressed and writing a compression layer | **Compressed columns with dictionaries** for `VARCHAR`/`BLOB`/`JSON` (`COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED`) |
| `UUID()` or random `uuid_v4()` as a primary key | Install `component_uuid_vx_udf` and use `uuid_v7()` — time-ordered, so it doesn't fragment the clustered index |
| A second admin account for monitoring that shows up in `mysql.user` | The **utility user** (`my.cnf`) is invisible to `mysql.user`/`performance_schema` and unmodifiable by root |

## Instrumentation & Diagnostics

Percona Server roughly doubles the visibility of stock MySQL (95 vs 65 `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables; 853 vs 434 global counters).

### User Statistics
Per-thread, per-user, per-client, per-table, and per-index counters — none of which exist in community MySQL.
```sql
SET GLOBAL userstat = ON;                       -- enable (off by default)
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STATISTICS ORDER BY ROWS_READ DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEX_STATISTICS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'orders';
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_STATISTICS;
```
Use this to find unused indexes (zero rows in `INDEX_STATISTICS`) and hot tables without parsing logs.

### Extended Slow Query Log
The slow log carries far more per-query detail than upstream — rows examined/sent, query plan flags, InnoDB I/O, temp tables, and more — controlled by `log_slow_verbosity`. Pairs directly with `pt-query-digest` (see `percona-toolkit`).
```sql
SET GLOBAL log_slow_verbosity = 'full';
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = ON;
```

Also available: enhanced `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`, undo-segment and temp-table information, and thread-based profiling.

## Security & Encryption

Percona Server brings several encryption capabilities that are Enterprise-only or missing upstream:

- **Data-at-rest encryption** beyond core: binary/relay logs, temporary files, the doublewrite buffer, and enforcement (`table_encryption_privilege_check`, `default_table_encryption`).
- **Keyring components/plugins**: keyring file *and* **HashiCorp Vault** (Enterprise-only in MySQL).
- **Audit Log Filter** (`8.0+` component model) — rule-based auditing with JSON/XML output, compression, and encryption. The older Audit Log plugin is still available; prefer the filter component for new setups.
- **Data Masking** component — `mask_inner()`, `gen_rnd_email()`, etc., open-source (Enterprise-only upstream).
- **PAM authentication** plugin (Enterprise-only upstream).

```sql
-- discover unused indexes, then check encryption coverage
SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME, CREATE_OPTIONS
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE CREATE_OPTIONS LIKE '%ENCRYPTION%';
```

## Storage Engines

- **MyRocks** (`8.0+`, `8.4+`) — RocksDB-based LSM engine bundled with Percona Server, optimized for write-heavy workloads and high compression. Install the package and enable it; it is not loaded by default:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install percona-server-rocksdb      # or the yum equivalent
  ps-admin --enable-rocksdb                     # registers the plugin + tablespaces
  ```
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE events (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, payload JSON) ENGINE=ROCKSDB;
  ```
  MyRocks has real limitations (gap locks, foreign keys, mixing engines in a transaction) — see [MyRocks limitations](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.4/myrocks-limitations.html) before adopting.
- **Improved MEMORY engine** and InnoDB enhancements (configurable fast index creation, full-text search improvements, corrupt-table handling via `innodb_corrupt_table_action`).

## Operational Features

| Feature | What it gives you | Min version |
|---|---|---|
| **Backup locks** — `LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP` (+ `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP`) | Lightweight locking for consistent backups without blocking reads/most writes | 8.0+ |
| **Kill idle transactions** — `kill_idle_transaction` | Auto-end transactions idle past a timeout, freeing locks/undo | 8.0+ |
| **Threadpool** — `thread_handling=pool-of-threads` | Scales connection counts without thread-per-connection overhead | 8.0+ |
| **Extended `SHOW GRANTS`** | Shows roles and all grants in one statement | 8.0+ |
| **Compressed columns with dictionaries** — `COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED` | Per-column compression for `VARCHAR`/`BLOB`/`JSON` | 8.0+ |
| **Enforce storage engine** — `enforce_storage_engine` | Reject tables created with the wrong engine (DBaaS guardrail) | 8.0+ |
| **Improved `START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`** | Consistent snapshot incl. binlog position for backups | 8.0+ |

```sql
-- backup-safe locking (what XtraBackup does internally)
LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP;        -- block DDL + non-transactional writes, allow InnoDB DML
-- ... copy / snapshot ...
UNLOCK TABLES;
-- LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP; ... UNLOCK INSTANCE;  -- MySQL-native, blocks DDL only
```

## Components & UDFs Worth Knowing

Percona Server ships extra components/UDFs you `INSTALL` on demand:

```sql
-- UUIDv7 for index-friendly primary keys (time-ordered, unlike random UUIDv4/UUID())
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_uuid_vx_udf';
SELECT uuid_v7();                                   -- 019010f6-0426-70f0-...
SELECT uuid_vx_to_timestamp('0190...');             -- extract creation time

-- Compression dictionaries for repetitive JSON/text columns
CREATE COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY ev_keys ('timestamp' 'status' 'user_id' 'payload');
CREATE TABLE events (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  data JSON COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED WITH COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY ev_keys
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

-- PITR helpers: locate the binlog containing a GTID
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_binlog_utils_udf';
SELECT CAST(get_binlog_by_gtid('<uuid>:123') AS CHAR);
```

- **Utility user** — an invisible admin account for automation/DBaaS, configured only in `my.cnf` (`utility_user`, `utility_user_password`, `utility_user_privileges`, `utility_user_schema_access`). It never appears in `mysql.user`, `USER_STATISTICS`, or `performance_schema`, and root cannot see or modify it.
- **ProcFS plugin** — read `/proc` files via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCFS` (always with a `WHERE FILE=...`); useful where you can't shell into the OS.
- **Threadpool tuning** — `thread_pool_size` (≈ CPU cores), `thread_pool_stall_limit`, `thread_pool_high_prio_mode`; built into the binary (not a plugin). Most beneficial at high connection counts.

Several larger areas — **data-at-rest encryption** (incl. KMIP/AWS KMS keyrings), the **Audit Log Filter**, **data masking**, and **JavaScript stored procedures** (`js_lang`, tech preview 8.4) — are deep enough for their own guidance; check the docs for full SQL.
